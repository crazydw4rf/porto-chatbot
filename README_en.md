## Deploy to Vercel Serverless Function

This project is configured to be deployed to Vercel as a serverless function. Follow these steps:

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Vercel

After creating a project in Vercel:

1. Open your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
3. Add the following variables:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key
   - `CORS_DOMAINS`: Allowed domains (example: `https://yourapp.vercel.app` or `*` for all)

### 2. Deploy

There are two ways to deploy:

2. Import the repository in Vercel dashboard
3. Vercel will automatically build and deploy

**Method 2: Through Vercel CLI**

npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel

# Follow the prompts
```

### 3. Testing

After successful deployment, you can test the endpoint:

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "What is Ucup'\''s experience with Docker?"}'
```

## Notes

- The `web/` folder contains frontend files (e.g., index.html).
- If you want to change the port, edit the following part in `main.go`:
  ```go
  err := app.Listen(":3000")
  ```
  Replace `3000` with your desired port.

## Modifying Portfolio Instructions

If you want to change the portfolio context used by the chatbot, modify the `UcupPortfolio` constant value in the `instruction/portfolio.go` file.

Example:
```go
const UcupPortfolio = `Here is a brief portfolio about Ucup:
Ucup is a Backend Developer experienced in building APIs with Go and PostgreSQL...`
```
Make sure to adjust the content according to your needs.
